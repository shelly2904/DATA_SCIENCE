              "54605  On XX/XX/2020, sometime before XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX called not only my employer, but the office of the Director at my place of employment for the city of   XXXX on behalf of Reliant Capital Solutions. She did not call with questions attempting to identify my location. This company is not the original debt owner. She identified her employer without being asked. My place of employment does not allow personal calls at work. It prohibits personal calls on work time. I was notified via an official email from my Director 's personal assistant. I do not wish the stress caused by this blatant invasion on privacy and violation of the FDCPA amongst other violations. If I lose my job, I will surely sue for lost wages.This account is not even reported on my credit report. I have not ever received any written documentation from this company prior to the escalation of calling the Top office for the company I work for. This is blatant harrassment! An official cease and desist letter has been sent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ...
